the bike battery mount clips onto a circular bike tube. 

it has two compartments. one is meant to be sealed and contains the dc2dc converter.  the second is open ended so you can slot in your battery. theres a hole in one face of the battery holder so you can add a velcro based strap

the dc2dc converter i've used is:

and the battery is:

the STL folder contains STL's that you can view with github's viewr to give you an idea of what it looks like. please do not use this stl - it probably wont print.
